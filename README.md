## The Astrology API

This rails application scrapes several publications across the web that have a weekly, daily, or monthly horoscopes section, and compiles the results in a  in a public-facing API (not currently live). Once deployed, the API will be accessible to anyone with the url, and will allow users to search for and sort horoscopes by publication, date, author name, keywords, sign, and other attributes. Anyone is free to use this information in their application, and is kindly asked to include the author's name along with any horoscopes written by that author.

## A note about Copyright

I do not claim authorship or ownership of any of the content (horoscopes) available in my database ! These articles are freely available online by the publications where they originally appeared, and users and developers are encouraged to visit the  articles at the urls provided in the database to read them in their original format. The rights to this content remains with the original publication or author, according to the agreements made between them, and any questions about use of this content for commercial gain should be directed at the publication or author in question. 

My intention is to both catalogue these horoscopes in an organized fashion, as well as provide a record for authors of the number of horoscopes they have written. It will also be a way of keeping these horoscopes available for anyone to read even in the event that the publication decides to no longer display the article on their website.

Eventually, I hope to develop a simple interface that uses this API to provide users a tabular horoscope-reading experience, where a user could flip through publications with ease, reading the same horoscope for the given day, month, or year on up to ten different publications, comparing the writing styles and predictions given by each author.

If you are a publication or owner of this content and wish for some content to be removed, please contact me at sbalsom@protonmail.com to discuss this, and I will be happy to accomodate your wish.
